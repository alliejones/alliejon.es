One of my recent personal goals has been to get more comfortable with writing about technical and programming topics. Starting a new blog seemed like a good way to practice this.

So naturally I got totally sidetracked by choosing the right platform, trying to port over my portfolio to a new format and agonizing over what kind of design it should have ... which is why I haven't actually written anything, despite intending to for months now.

However, for the next three months I am fortunate enough to be attending [Hacker School](http://www.hackerschool.com/), where I have the freedom to learn about whatever cool and interesting programming topics I want---things I should definitely write about! So no more procrastination; Octopress' default template it is.

I've been in New York and at Hacker School for a week now and so far things have been awesome. More thoughts on that later!
