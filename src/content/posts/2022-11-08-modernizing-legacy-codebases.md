As part of Etsy's [Code as Craft talk series](https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/events), I spoke with [Marianne Belotti](https://www.bellotti.tech/) about our experiences wrangling with legacy code. It was a really fun conversation, and I'd highly recommend her book [Kill It with Fire](https://nostarch.com/kill-it-fire).
